 University Admission Bot  
 Generative AI Project – GenZ Program (Intermediate Level)



 Project Title
 University Admission Bot using Generative AI**



Introduction

The **University Admission Bot** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist students with university admission-related queries.  
It acts as a virtual admission counselor, providing instant responses regarding courses, eligibility criteria, admission process, important dates, and frequently asked questions.

This project is developed as an **Intermediate-level Generative AI project** under the **GenZ Program**, demonstrating the practical use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the education domain.


 Problem Statement

Universities receive a large number of repetitive admission-related queries from students, which leads to:
- Delay in responses
- Increased workload for admission staff
- Poor user experience for students

There is a need for an **intelligent, automated, and conversational system** that can handle these queries efficiently.


 Proposed Solution

The University Admission Bot uses **Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand user questions and provide accurate, human-like responses.  
It can operate 24/7 and guide students throughout the admission process without human intervention.



 Objectives

- To build an AI-based chatbot for university admissions
- To provide quick and accurate admission information
- To reduce manual workload on admission offices
- To demonstrate real-world use of Generative AI
- To create a user-friendly and interactive chatbot experience
